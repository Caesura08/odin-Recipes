    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><h4>
        <li>3 1/2 cups Flour</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoon of yeast</li>
        <li>2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1/2 - 3/4 cups of sugar</li>
        <li>cooking oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of salt</li>
    </h4></ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol><h4>
        <li><strong>Activate the yeast:</strong> Mix salt, water, and yeast. Set it aside for 5 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Add flour and mix</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and rise:</strong> Let the mixture rise for approx. 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-heat the oil:</strong> In a large saucepan, pour vegetable oil into a pot until it's about 3 inches high and place in low heat</li>
        <li><strong>Check the heat:</strong> Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. if the oil is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom instead of rising to the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the puff puff:</strong> When the oil is hot enough, use a spoon to dish up the batter and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the oil. Sort of in the shape of a ball.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the doneness:</strong> Fry for minutes until the bottom side is golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip the puff puff:</strong> Turn the ball over for a few minutees until the inderside is golden brown</li>
        <li><strong>Remove from oil:</strong> Use a large sppoon or a slotted spoon to take it out of the oil. Place on napkins to help soak up the excess oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Puff Puff</strong>This step isn't necessary, but you can roll up the finished products in table sugar or powdered sugar to make it sweeter</li>
