        <p class="fix">Birria has always been a staple dish within the mexican community. Traditionally, it is made with goat or lamb, but beef has become a very popular meat substitute. It is usually cooked for 
        special occassions such as holidays, weddings and parties, but with its popularization on TikTok,
        it has become a more everyday dish, with it being a more popular option in mexican restraunts and food trucks.
        It can be served in various forms! Such as quesabirria tacos, birria fries, birria quesadillas, Even birria pizza! But my personal favorite 
        variation has to be birria ramen.</p>

                <li>4 to 5 lbs of beef chuck roast</li>
                <li>2 cups of beef broth</li>
                <li>1/4 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
                <li>2 Roma tomatos</li>
                <li>1/2 medium yellow onion</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="small header">Instructions</p>
            <ol id="list">
                <li>Season your meat on both sides with salt and pepper. Then set a Dutch oven or pot over medium-hight heat with olive oil. Add the meat and sear on all sides until browned. You might need to work in two batches depending on how big your pot is. Ounce all meat is seared, set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium pot, add all of the dried chiles, tomatoes, onion, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and peppercorns, covering everything completely with water. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the chiles are softened, transfer everything to a bledner and add 1 cup of chile-soaked water. Add in the broth, vinegar and the remaining spices. Blend until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Strain the blended sauce into pot with the seared meat (if necessary, depending on the power of your blender), gently stir, and bring to a boil. Bring heat to low, cover, and cook for 3-3 1/2 hours, until meat is fall-apart tender.</li>
                <li>Take the meat out to shred, and add shredded meat back to consome.</li>

        <p id="serving">Serving Birria</p>
            <div>Birria can be served in many ways. As stew, in tacos, on nachos, or even in noodles for birria ramen. Whichever way you choose to enjoy in, makes sure to serve it with plenty of the consome for dipping and slurping.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong style="color: blueviolet;">As a stew:</strong> Serve birria as a stew in bowls with lots of diced white onion, chopped cilantro, and freshly squeezed line juice.</li>
                <li><strong style="color: blueviolet;">As tacos:</strong> Birria tacos (aka quesabirria) are one of the most delicious things you can make. Dip a corn tortilla in the top of the sauce, then lightly fry it in a hot skillet. The top of the sauce will be mostly fat that has risen to the top from the beef, so it will fry beautifully without having to 
                add additional oil. Add in some shredded beef, plenty of Oaxaca (quesillo) or Chihuahua cheese, and cook until the cheese is melted and the taco is crispy. Serve with a side of the sauce and a lot of cilantro, diced onions, and lime juice.</li>
